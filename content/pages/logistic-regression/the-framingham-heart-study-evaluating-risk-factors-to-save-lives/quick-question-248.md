Quick Question
--------------

In Video 3, we built a logistic regression model and found that the following variables were significant (or almost significant) for predicting ten year risk of CHD: male, age, number of cigarettes per day, whether or not the patient previously had a stroke, whether or not the patient is currently hypertensive, total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and blood glucose level. Which **one** of the following variables would be the most dramatically affected by a behavioral intervention? HINT: Think about how much control the patient has over each of the variables.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Male&nbsp;

&nbsp;Age&nbsp;

&nbsp;Number of Cigarettes per day&nbsp;

&nbsp;Previously had a Stroke&nbsp;

&nbsp;Hypertensive&nbsp;

&nbsp;Total Cholesterol Level&nbsp;

&nbsp;Systolic Blood Pressure&nbsp;

&nbsp;Blood Glucose Level&nbsp;

Explanation

The number of cigarettes smoked per day would be the most dramatically affected by a behavioral intervention. This is a variable that the patient has the ability to control the most.
