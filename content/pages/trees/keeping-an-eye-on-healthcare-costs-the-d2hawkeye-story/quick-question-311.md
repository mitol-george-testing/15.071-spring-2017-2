Quick Question
--------------

In what ways do you think an analytics approach to predicting healthcare cost will improve upon the previous approach of human judgment? Select all that apply.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;It will allow D2Hawkeye to analyze millions of patients.&nbsp;

&nbsp;It will allow D2Hawkeye to make predictions faster than doctors can.&nbsp;

&nbsp;It will allow D2Hawkeye use all available data (millions of cases) to make decisions.&nbsp;

Explanation

All of the above are correct. There are many advantages to having an analytics approach to predict cost. However, it is important that the models are interpretable, so trees are a great model to use in this situation.
