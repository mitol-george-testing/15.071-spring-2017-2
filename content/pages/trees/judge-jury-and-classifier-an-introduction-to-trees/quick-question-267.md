Quick Question
--------------

Suppose you have a subset of 20 observations, where 14 have outcome A and 6 have outcome B. What proportion of observations have outcome A?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

Explanation

The fraction of observations that have outcome A is 14/20 = 0.7.

Quick Question
--------------

The following questions ask about the subset of 20 observations from the previous question.

If we set the threshold to 0.25 when computing predictions of outcome A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

Exercise 2

&nbsp;A&nbsp;

&nbsp;B&nbsp;

If we set the threshold to 0.5 when computing predictions of outcome A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

Exercise 3

&nbsp;A&nbsp;

&nbsp;B&nbsp;

If we set the threshold to 0.75 when computing predictions of outcome A, will we predict A or B for these observations?

Exercise 4

&nbsp;A&nbsp;

&nbsp;B&nbsp;

Explanation

Since 70% of these observations have outcome A, we will predict A if the threshold is below 0.7, and we will predict B if the threshold is above 0.7.
